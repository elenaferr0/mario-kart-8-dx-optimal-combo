# Mario Kart 8 Deluxe best combos: the Combinatorial Optimization & Game Theory approach

<img src="wallpaper.png" style="border-radius: 10px">

This project uses the $docplex$ library in Python to find the optimal combination of driver, body, tires, and glider in
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe based on their associated statistics. The goal is to maximize the sum of the chosen parts' stats.

## Data

The script reads data from four CSV files (`drivers.csv`, `bodies.csv`, `tires.csv`, `gliders.csv`) located in the `data`
subdirectory. Each CSV file should have the first column as the unique identifier (e.g., driver name, body name) and
subsequent columns containing numerical statistics for that item.
This data has been extracted from
the [Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Wiki](https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_8_Deluxe_in-game_statistics).

The script then formulates an integer programming model to select at most one item from each category (driver, body,
tires, glider) such that the sum of their combined statistics is maximized.

## Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x:** (any version >= 3.6 and <= 3.8.x)
* **CPLEX Optimization Studio or CPLEX Python API ($docplex$):**
   ```bash
   pip install cplex docplex
   ```

## Combinatorial Optimization

### Best overall combo

> [!NOTE]
> Just like Mario Kart 7 and Mario Kart 8, the game stores statistics for drivers and parts in points. In each
> statistics, the sum of the points for the driver, body, tires, and glider is a number potentially ranging from 0 to
> 20,
> called Level (Lv) in Mario Kart 7, that then determines the values of the related in-game statistics.

Hence, to find the best overall combo, we need to find the combination of driver, body, tires, and glider that maximizes
the sum of their statistics. The script does this by creating a binary variable for each item in each category and
adding constraints to ensure that only one item from each category is selected.

#### Integer Linear Programming model
A very simple integer linear programming model is used to find optimal combinations.

The following sets are given as inputs:

- $D$: set of drivers
- $B$: set of bodies
- $T$: set of tires
- $G$: set of gliders

The following decision variables are defined:

- $d_i$: binary variable indicating whether driver $i$ is selected (1) or not (0)
- $b_i$: binary variable indicating whether body $i$ is selected (1) or not (0)
- $t_i$: binary variable indicating whether tire $i$ is selected (1) or not (0)
- $g_i$: binary variable indicating whether glider $i$ is selected (1) or not (0)

> These variables are needed to ensure that only one item from each category is selected.

For the sake of simplicity and brevity, the following notation is used:

- $ds_i$: the sum of all statistics for the driver $i$ (e.g., speed, acceleration, weight, handling, traction, etc.)
- $bs_i$: the sum of all statistics for the body $i$
- $ts_i$: the sum of all statistics for the tires $i$
- $gs_i$: the sum of all statistics for the glider $i$

For instance,

$$
ds\_(\text{biddybuggy}) = \text{Speed (Ground)} + \text{Speed (Water)} + \text{Speed (Air)} + \text{Speed (Anti-Gravity)} + \text{Acceleration (AC)} + \text{Weight (WG)} + \text{Handling (Ground)} + \text{Handling (Water)} + \text{Handling (Air)} + \text{Handling (Anti-Gravity)} + \text{(Off-Road) Traction (OF)} + \text{Mini-Turbo (MT)} + \text{Invincibility (IV)} + \text{On-Road Traction (ON)}
$$

$$
= 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 7 + 0 + 5 + 4 = 20
$$

Objective function (for the overall best combo):

$$
max \sum_{i=1}^{|D|} d_i \cdot ds_i + \sum_{i=1}^{|B|} b_i \cdot bs_i + \sum_{i=1}^{|T|} t_i \cdot ts_i + \sum_{i=1}^{|G|} g_i \cdot gs_i
$$

$s.t.$

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{|D|} d_i \leq 1 \quad\forall i \in D \quad\quad\text{(1)}
$$
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{|B|} b_i \leq 1 \quad\forall i \in B \quad\quad\text{(2)}
$$
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{|T|} t_i \leq 1 \quad\forall i \in T \quad\quad\text{(3)}
$$
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{|G|} g_i \leq 1 \quad\forall i \in G \quad\quad\text{(4)}
$$
$$
d_i, b_i, t_i, g_i \in \{0, 1\} \quad\forall i \in D, B, T, G
$$

Constraints $(1)$, $(2)$, $(3)$, and $(4)$ ensure that only one item from each category is selected.

> [!TIP]

This model has been used for all the combos in the table below. The only difference are the considered drivers (e.g. in
case of light/medium/heavy weight combos) or the stats considered. For instance, to obtain the fastest combo $ds_i$ is
computed as follows:

$$
ds_i = \text{Speed (Ground)} + \text{Speed (Water)} + \text{Speed (Air)} + \text{Speed (Anti-Gravity)}
$$

## Game Theory
### Pareto optimality
A solution is Pareto optimal if there is no other solution that is better in at least one objective without being worse in
another. 

> [!NOTE]
For instance, if we have two solutions $A$ (speed 1, acceleration 2) and $B$ (speed 2, acceleration 1), then $A$ is
better than $B$ in speed, but worse in acceleration. Hence, $A$ is not Pareto optimal because there is a solution that is
better in one objective (speed) and worse in another (acceleration). On the other hand, if we have two solutions $A$
(speed 1, acceleration 2) and $B$ (speed 2, acceleration 3), then $B$ is Pareto optimal.


#### Results
> [!NOTE]
> Several _equivalent_ combinations will yield the same total score (e.g. Wario Wing, Plane Glider, Gold Glider and Paraglider for the _Best Overall_ combo). They will be listed exaustively on the right column of each result table.
